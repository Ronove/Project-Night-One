Takeshi Nonomiya

A falsely-accused boy obsessed
with uncovering the truth with
photographs.
He stalked Yoko Numata and
continously harassed her by
taking secret photographs and
sending them to her.

However, he ability to take
photographs of others without
them noticing is genius tier.
His true calling might be as a
paparazzi or as a private eye
who takes photos of extra-
marital affairs.

He loves pictures of wild
birds, and his dream is to
one day be a freelance wild
bird photographer.
