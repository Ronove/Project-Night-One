Yoko Numata

She wants to be a simple 'mori
girl'. She was a cute girl
loved by everyone. It's
unfortunate that her friends
framed Nonomiya to protect her.
Thanks to Higanbana's chance,
she was able to rest in peace,
and now she's attending school
in paradise.

Sometimes, it seems she comes
back as a ghost and mingles
among her former classmates.

Nonomiya wouldn't admit it,
but it's clear he really
liked her.
