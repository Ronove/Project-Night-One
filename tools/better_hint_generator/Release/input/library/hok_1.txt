Nurse

Her tacky attire can
almost be counted as one
of the 7 mysteries. Her
favorite saying is there
are no encounters and
there are no good men. She
even grumbles this to the
students.

She has a light supernatural
sense, and on occasion it
seems she can even sense
Higanbana's presence.
Taking care of Higanbana's
doll, she is her guardian.

Immune like a spiritual
ward, she is completely
safe even in the middle
of Higanbana's aura.
