Yoshihito Kanamori

Marie's homeroom teacher in her
past life. He was a lively and
popular teacher among the
girls. But he kept a wild
animal inside of himself, and
Marie was its outlet.

A villain like him didn't have
a pleasant demise. In the end,
Marie who had become
Mesomeso-san crushed his entire
body into dust.

Nonetheless, until the very end
everyone but Marie thought he
was a good teacher.
