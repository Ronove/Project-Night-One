Higanbana

School Youkai of the Third
Rank. The Dancing Higanbana.
It is said that in the middle
of the night a doll dances atop
the cabinets of the infirmary.
Cursing and injuring others,
she is the infirmary's
master.

She is feared even by other
youkai for her brutality.
However, Marie sees through
her demonic persona and the
two somehow get along.

She spends her days in the
infirmary usually eating
steamed buns while watching
anime late into the night.
