The Black Tea Gentleman

Not ranked among the Eight
School Youkai, but it is
whispered that he is the
shadow second rank in power.
As the right hand of the
Headmaster, he is a powerful
youkai known as the Vice
Principal. He holds the power
to amplify the dreams of
children and let them escape
reality. He can be seen as
either overflowing with
kindness or with cruelty.
He is the natural enemy of
youkai like Higanbana who hunt
by inviting their victims
to die.
His hobby is to read
children's writings about
their 'Dreams of the Future.'
