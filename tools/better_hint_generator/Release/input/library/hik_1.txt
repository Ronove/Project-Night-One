Hikaru Nihei

A brilliant youth. He looks
down upon his inept class-
mates. He started attending
cram school from an early
age and earns the best
grades. He continued to
look down upon his peers
more and more.

He was bullied because of
that, and so he channeled
his anger through attacking
rabbits. He should have at
least stopped at grinding
his erasers into dust.

He's slightly mental.
He hides a twisted split
personality within the
darkness of his own mind.
