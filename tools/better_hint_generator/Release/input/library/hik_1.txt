Hikaru Nihei

A brilliant youth. He looks
down upon his inept class-
mates. He started attending
cram school from an early
age and earns the best
grades. He began to look
down upon his peers more
and more as time went on.

He was bullied because of
that, and so he channeled
his anger through attacking
rabbits. He should have
just stopped at grinding
his erasers into bits.

He's slightly mental.
He hides a twisted split
personality within the
darkness of his own mind.
