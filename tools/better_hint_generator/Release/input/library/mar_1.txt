Marie Moriya

School Youkai of the 8th Rank.
Mesomeso-san. A youkai rumored
to live in the former school
building's bathroom. Even if
one hears it talking through
the door, they must not reply.
Unimpeded in her Youkai form,
she became stronger than she
was in life.

Instead of going on the
occasional hunt, she sometimes
sneaks into the cafeteria.

She also posesses a mysterious
ability to find tea cakes from
seemingly thin air.
