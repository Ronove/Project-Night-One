Michiru Sakurada

A girl with a self-proclaimed
sixth sense. She really had
the gift to sense the super-
natural. She is revered by a
club of occult girls who
believe in exorcisms and
the power of charms.
And although it already had
healed, she doesn't take
off her eye patch. It's her
evil eye. 

She often dresses up in goth-
loli outfits due to her
parents hobbies. Her favorite
brand name is Auntie Rosa.

Her spiritual powers rapidly
accelerated after her meeting
with Mesomeso-san.
