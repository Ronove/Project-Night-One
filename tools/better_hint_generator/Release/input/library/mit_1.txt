Michiru Sakurada

A girl with a self-proclaimed
sixth sense. She really does
have the gift to sense the
supernatural. She is revered
by a club of occult girls who
believe in exorcisms and
the power of charms.
And although it healed a long
time ago, she doesn't take
off her eye patch. It's her
evil eye. 

She often dresses up in goth-
loli outfits due to her
parents hobbies. Her favorite
brand name is Auntie Rosa.

Her spiritual powers rapidly
accelerated after her meeting
with Mesomeso-san.
