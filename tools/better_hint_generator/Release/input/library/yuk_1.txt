Yukari Sakaki

A pitiful girl made the target
of bullying because of
unfortunate circumstances at
home. She tried to stay strong
after her mother's death,
but it was difficult for her
at that age.

She has a complex because
she's taller than most boys,
and cute clothes don't suit her.

She hates bullying, and when
boys go beyond playful pranks
she often snaps at them.
Perhaps beleiving that kind of
personality is cool, her
popularity is rising among
the girls.
