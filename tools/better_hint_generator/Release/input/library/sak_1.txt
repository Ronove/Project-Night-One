Sakunoshin

takes off his mask. Thankfully,
While not strictly a School
Youkai, he is the leader of
the animal spirits in the area.

He looks like a fox, but
claims he is really a lion. He
has a calm disposition, but he
is truly a coward. He says he
can fight when it counts, but
he won't listen to the ghost
stories of curses in the night.

He loves pound fish cakes. The
infirmary nurse gives them
to him as offerings.
