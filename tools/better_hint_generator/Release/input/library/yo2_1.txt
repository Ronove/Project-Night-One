Yoko Numata

Receiving the cruel jeers of
her peers and terrifying
photographs from her stalker,
she committed suicide.

Once glimpsed by youkai that
incites suicide, her road to
self-destruction was
accelerated.

Since the spirit of one that
commits suicide is beloved by
the youkai, there was no
peace after death for her.
Made the plaything of the
youkai, she endlessly wanders
the bottom of a freezing hell.
