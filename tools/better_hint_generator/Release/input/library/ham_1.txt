Hameln

He calls himself Hameln of the
 music room. He doesn't rank
among the eight school youkai.
It's said that if one hears
the sound of his castanets
they will be transformed into
an animal. While he liked the
pipe, he couldn't monologue
while blowing one, so he
changed instruments.

Since he has a moody
disposition, he is well
suited as a youkai. And clealy
he gave Hikaru about the same
treatment as a lamp.

He's a frightful man when he
takes off his mask. Thankfully,
he loves masks.
