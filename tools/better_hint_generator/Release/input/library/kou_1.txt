The Headmaster

School Youkai of the First
Rank. The Headmaster.
It is said that he slips out
a photo of a principal from
ages past in the principal's
office and wanders around
the campus grounds.
It is said that he spirits
away students that he meets
and erases any trace of their
existence from reality itself.
He shows a calm disposition but
he hides a terrifying brutality.
Now he's older, but once he
was a youkai who could devour
entire schools.
It seems he has a terrifying
wife as well. So it seems
he spends his time at school
to avoid going home.
