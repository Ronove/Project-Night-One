Midori Kusunoki

She once had a lot of respect
and boasted the wealth of
her household. But now she is
being neglected in class and
being treated exactly the
opposite. In reality and on
the stage, she's the vain girl
who wants to be a princess.

With the Black Tea Gentleman's
power, today she is performing
as a princess on a stage that
exists only for her to see.

Incidently she does have a lot
of acting ability. If she can
put up with her current
misfortunes, she'll surely
blossom.
