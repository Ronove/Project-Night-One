Sumire

Wearing a kimono the color of
sumire (violet). She appears
just like a doll that would
fit in at a tea ceremony.
She used to play among the
other children wearing this,
but she was bullied for it.

Because she became bullied,
she mass produced bullies
as a spectacle. She is happy
the more bullied she is, but
now the unknown pleasures
she's taking interest in are
terrifying.

She often butts heads with
Higanbana over prey, and so
they are rivals in hunting.
