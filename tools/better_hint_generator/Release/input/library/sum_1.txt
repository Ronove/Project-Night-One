Sumire

Seventh Rank of the School
Youkai. Sumire of the Twilight.
If someone plays in the school
yard until late in the day,
they'll discover a strange
girl. It's whispered that this
youkai leads those children
astray and spirits them away.

It seems she was once a child
raised learning the ways of
tea ceremony on a tatami. But
the malicious modern society
changed her. She became the
bullying youkai.

Since there's no TV in the
tea room, she's envious that
Higanbana has a TV.
