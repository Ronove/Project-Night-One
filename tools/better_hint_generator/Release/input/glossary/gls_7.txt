Chrysanthemums in Japanese
culture, especially if they
are white or yellow, are
used at wakes and funerals
usually for bereavement
purposes.

In Chapter 4 of Higanbana,
Michiru is implying that
there may end up being
a potential memorial
service in the classroom
should anyone end up
dying from the Guardian
Deity's curse - thus the
classroom filled with
chrysanthemums.
