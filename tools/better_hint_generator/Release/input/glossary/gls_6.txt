Local deities, guardian spirits
or tutelary gods are common
in the animistic Japanese
religion of Shinto. Spirits
such as these typically act
as guardians for a local area,
keeping evil spirits at bay.
Often in Japan on the roadsides
one can find hokora, miniature
Shinto shrines, dedicated to
folk deities like guardian
spirits. These shrines
typically have tiny doors
that represent the closed
house of the deity, or are
marked off with rope and white
paper showing the shrine as
sacred space.
