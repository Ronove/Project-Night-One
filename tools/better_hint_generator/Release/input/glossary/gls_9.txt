Omikuji are paper fortunes at
Japanese Shinto shrines.
Fortunes start with a general
fortune which can vary from
very good luck to very bad
luck. After the general
fortune, there is usually a
series of fortunes about that
person's luck in business,
love, lucky directions,
and so forth. If the fortune
is bad, it's usually tied to
a tree to keep their bad luck
at the shrine, and if it's
good, it's also tied to the
tree to give it a boost, or
it can be kept for good luck.
