Jizo is a Buddhist bodhisattva
(Buddha-to-be, comparable to
saints in Catholicism) who
assists the Amida Buddha (the
Buddha of the Western
Paradise). Jizo is extremely
popular in Japan, and countless
varieties of statues dedicated
to him line the roadsides.
He saves children that have
died before their parents from
the underworld: such as aborted
fetuses, miscarriages, or still 
births. Often parents will give
offerings to the Jizo in the
form of red bibs, caps, and
toys.
