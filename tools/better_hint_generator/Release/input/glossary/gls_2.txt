Youkai
							  
Whether mischievous or 
malicious, youkai [yo-kye] are
supernatural demons, ghosts,
and monsters from Japanese
folklore and horror stories.
The term youkai covers a wide
range of beings from ghosts
disguised as beautiful women
to colossal centipedes. 
The most common youkai are:
tengu, long-nosed demons;
oni, ogres;
kappa, humanoid turtles;
kitsune, fox spirits. 
Although some youkai can be
beneficial like rain spirits
generally they exist to cause
humans misery either through
trickery or fear.
