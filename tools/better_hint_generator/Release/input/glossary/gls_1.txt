Mesomeso [meh-so-meh-so] is the
sound of someone sobbing,
usually after losing their self-
respect or from having low
self-esteem. Often the head
hangs limply as the person
cries.
 
In Higanbana no Saku Yoru Ni,
Mesomeso is given the Japanese
honorific suffix '-san'
(Mesomeso-san), which is often
comparable to the English Mr.,
Mrs., or Ms.. '-Chan' a
childish suffix, and '-kun'
a slightly masculine suffix
are also used throughout this
translation.
