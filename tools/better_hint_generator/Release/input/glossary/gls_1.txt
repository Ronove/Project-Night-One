Mesomeso [meh-so-meh-so] is the
sound of someone sobbing,
usually after losing their self-
respect or from having low
self-esteem. Often the head
hangs limply as the person
cries.
 
In Higanbana no Saku Yoru Ni,
Mesomeso is given the Japanese
honorific suffix '-san'
(Mesomeso-san), which is often
comparable to the English Mr.,
Mrs., or Ms.. Others include
'-chan' a childish suffix,
'-kun' a slightly masculine
suffix that can also be used
by teachers on students
regardless of gender,
and '-sama' a suffix denoting
respect.
