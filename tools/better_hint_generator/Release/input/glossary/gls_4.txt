Since the 1960s, Bell Marks
have been embedded in
Japanese elementary school
as a popular activity.

Bell Marks can be found on
many products, and students
can cut them out and gather
them to turn in to their
teachers at the end of the
month. Depending on how many
bell marks students turn in,
the school benefits by
receiving funds from the
Bell Mark Foundation, and
they can use those funds on
school supplies and equipment.
