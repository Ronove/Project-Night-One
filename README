Higanbana no Saku Yoru Ni - The First Night
Translation Project Readme File
10/11/2011 Last Updated

** Welcome to the project translation soldier!

** If you're translating or doing quality checkwork, 
   open up the various .script files with a text editor of your choice
   to view the code.
   
** CAUTION:
** The scripts are littered with various special characters, but make sure
   your encoding is set to <Shift-JIS> to avoid scrambled/misleading characters.

*************************************************************************************
** Project File Notes
*************************************************************************************
* make_all.bat		
					 Exports all resources and creates a patch in the
					 build/HiganbanaEnglish folder.
				
					  *Extended note:
					   Put this entire folder (HiganbanaEnglish) into your
					   Higanbana Folder (default C:\Program Files(x86)\07th Expansion\Higanbana)
					   Then run onscripter-en.exe to start reading the translated novel.

* scripts.txt		
					 Defines the .script files to use when compiling the
					 script into nscript.dat.
				  
					  *Extended note:
					   nscript.dat holds all the game text, and it's what our project
					   modifies. scripts.txt is primarily for advanced purposes of 
					   organizing the order of the script files. Also all files
					   themselves must have several empty lines at the top and
					   bottom to prevent a rare exception from occuring which
					   could foul up the order of the nscript.dat file.
					   Which leads to potentially disastrous results.

For any questions, comments on the bat files / scripts.txt (if something doesn't work/etc)
Contact our programmer, Nicolas, his email is nicolasg AT uvic DOT ca

* continuity.txt	
					 This is useful information on previous translated issues if someone
					 wants to maintain consistancy with said translation.

** Project Folder Notes
*************************************************************************************
* /build			
					 This is where everything from make_all.bat is generated.

					 *Extended Note
					   Put this entire folder (HiganbanaEnglish) into your
					   Higanbana Folder (default C:\Program Files(x86)\07th Expansion\Higanbana)
					   Then run onscripter-en.exe to start reading the translated novel.					 

* /graphics			
					 Holds all files generated when creating the arc.nsa file.

					 *Extended Note
					   NSA files are where all the art assets are held.
					   For the purposes of our project, our arc file simply 'overrides'
					   without 'replacing' the default files. So our patch can be
					   superimposed in a subdirectory of a legal copy of Higanbana
					   no Saku Yoru Ni. Thus requiring the original game, and not
					   requiring all the graphics from the original game when making the files.

* /design			
					 This is where supplemental images / concepts are stored.
					 e.g. Mockups for the glossary, splash screens, logos.

* /export			
					 Stores a generated nscript.dat file that can be replaced
					 inside your HiganbanaEnglish folder for the latest script
					 rather than generating an entirely new build.
					
* /font				
					 Holds the default font file used in the translation.
					 Currently we use: Sazanami Gothic Regular (さざなみゴシックRegular)
					  
* /icon				
					 Holds the icon file that's generated with the make_all / make_icon.bat files
					 This icon is then applied to the onscripter-en.exe.

* /notepad++		
					 This holds a userdefined language for nscripter in notepad++.
					 Completely optional and purely aesthetic. Look up your operating
					 system and how to apply it online (Sorry, no instructions here!).
					  
* /onscripter-en	
					 Contains the latest build of onscripter-en.exe. Can be replaced with
					 newer versions as they come along.
					  
* /SDL				
					 Contains the SDL libraries.

* /tools			
					 Contains tools for the project's bat files. Some are currently WIP,
					 (Work in Progress), so please avoid playing around with them just yet!

** .Script Special Character Notes

		Here's some instructions on the special characters
		you'll find in the .script files. Be sure to give a quick read before
		diving into the editing process.
*************************************************************************************

; (Semicolon)		
					 'Comments' out a line. This prevents text from being
					 displayed inside the novel as someone reads along. Usually
					 we comment out lines that are written in Japanese, so we add
					 a semicolon in front of them to prevent the reader from seeing
					 the Japanese lines. Then we add translations below said lines
					 to make it easier to refer to the original text.
Example...
;読めない所 (This can't be read normally)
`Translation here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
　 (Paragraph space)	
					 These are copied over from the Japanese lines.
					 They act as supplemental spaces for the beginning of paragraphs
					 and visual space. Be sure to include them on non-quote lines.
Example...
　Like this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
` (Tildes)			
					 Represent closed statements of text rendered in English.
					 If text is run without these tildes enclosing them, there is
					 potential for misrendered text (e.g. textwithoutspaces). So
					 be sure to enclose all text, even if it's in quotes already. 
Example...
`"Like this!"`

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ (At symbols)		
					 These are used as continuation markers. In essense they force
					 the reader to click to continue reading a line. If there's text
					 before or after it, make sure to add tildes to enclose the English
					 text that doesn't include the @ symbols.
Example...
`　For example, `@`something like this.`

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\ (Backslash)		
					 This causes the screen to clear after a line.

Example...
`　For example, `@`something like this.`\ 
;((The screen clears))
`　That was easy!`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/ (Forward slash)	
					 The purpose of this is somewhat unknown. It seems to function
					 almost like both a continuation and a music clearer.
					 If these are in the line, it's best not to remove them.
					  
Example...
`"So you're saying`/
`...you're Mesomeso-san?"`\
((This all comes out as one line, with a music break))
